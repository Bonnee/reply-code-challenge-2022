# Reply Code Challenge 2022
Team GuruDelVHDL (Me, the actual VHDL guru and [Simione](https://github.com/simoneruffini), a VHDL peasant) submission, worth 25735122 points and 90th place out of 2820 total teams.

`main_grandebotta.py` consisted in reordering the list of demons depending on how many fragments could be obtained in the remaining turns for each demon. The list was updated after killing a demon, making it quite slow.

`main_grandepeso.py` is a first experiment on a decreasing gradient of weights for the obtainable fragments so that the first fragments in the array have more weight. The results were good so we then tried to expand the weighting system to more parameters (`main_working.py` and `main_incomplete.py`), but time and caffeine ran out.

[Here](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) is a detailed explanation of the theory behind our solutions.
